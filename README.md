Create a simple to-do list app where the user can add, delete, and view their tasks.

Features:

The app should have a clean and user-friendly interface.

It should allow users to add a new task to their list.

It should allow users to delete a task from their list.

It should allow users to view their current list of tasks.

It should allow users to save their list of tasks to a file and load it back again later.

Steps to create the project:

Open a new Python file in your favourite text editor or IDE.

Define a class Task with attributes such as title, description, and status.

Define a class ToDoList with methods such as add_task(), delete_task(), view_tasks(), save_tasks(), and load_tasks().

Implement the logic for adding a new task to the to-do list, deleting a task from the to-do list, and viewing the current list of tasks.

Implement the logic for saving the list of tasks to a file and loading it back again later.

Test the app by running the Python file in your terminal or console.
